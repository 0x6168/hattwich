### more detail?
As a self-employed communication specialist holding a Master of Arts in Speech Science and coach for over a decade, I have witnessed the transformative power of effective communication. My journey has taken me from coaching individuals and groups to improve their communication skills, to lecturing at universities and working with theaters across Europe.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of helping 80+ clients achieve their goals by employing analytical approaches and designing tailored coaching programs. It has been incredibly fulfilling to witness the growth and success of individuals and groups as they unlock their potential in communication. However, as the world went through the challenges of the pandemic and many theatres closed, I suddenly had time on my hands:
I followed my curiosity, which had been patiently waiting  somewhere for this opportunity. I plunged into the world of AI. Things were happening at great speed, things I knew little about, but which were playing an increasingly important role in my life - data surrounds us. Intrigued by its transformative abilities, I made a bold decision - I am shifting my career towards data science. I want to use my analytical and communication skills to extract insights from data and contribute to solving complex problems. I want to build and understand its underlying infrastructure.

This is why I am currently undergoing an intensive data science training program at WBS Coding School. Here I gain hands-on project-based experience in various areas, including ETL, data modeling and integration, RESTful web APIs, AWS, and web scraping. Proficient in Python and SQL, with a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, I am continuously expanding my technical expertise.

I am keen to work in a collaborative team environment where I can further develop my engineering skills. I am passionate about promoting diversity and creating an inclusive working environment. I firmly believe in the power of teamwork and the importance of seeking input from colleagues to ensure thoroughness and accuracy. I like to get things up and running, and then dig into the details.

If you are looking for a dedicated team player with a passion for continuous learning and a collaborative mindset, I would love to contribute to your organization!
